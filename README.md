# Wayfinder3D

An application for comparing estimated travel times and directions on a 3D map.

Built with Python, CesiumJS and Google Maps API.

## Setup

`git clone https://github.com/willgeary/Wayfinder3D`

`cd Wayfinder3D`

(Optional) If you use anaconda, you can create and activate a virtual environment from the `environment.yml` file with:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

`source activate Wayfinder3D`

## Instructions

You can generate directions from an origin to a destination via four modes: driving, transit, bicycling and walking like this:

```
python run.py \
--origin="Washington Square Park, New York City" \
--destination="Central Park, New York City" \
--modes="driving,transit,bicycling,walking"
```

View your app by navigating to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.

Voil√†!

If you only want to view select modes, such as driving and transit, you can do so like this:

```
python run.py \
--origin="Venice" \
--destination="Milan" \
--modes="driving,transit"
```
